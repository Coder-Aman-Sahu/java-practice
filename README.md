# Java Practice Repository

Welcome to my Java Practice Repository! Here, I explore the realms of Java, diving into its syntax, concepts, and various challenges. This repository serves as a personal gym for my coding muscles, where I push the boundaries of my Java knowledge.

## What's Inside?

- **Basic Concepts**: Variables, Data Types, Operators, and more.
- **Control Structures**: If-Else, Switch, Loops, and Exception Handling.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Maps.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, and Algorithmic Challenges.
- **Advanced Topics**: Multithreading, I/O Streams, Networking, and JavaFX.
